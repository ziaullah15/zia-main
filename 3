    "description": "The “Bust of John the Baptist,” cast in bronze in 1886 from a model created in 1880 by Italian peasant Pignatelli from Abruzzi, embodies a unique blend of strength and spirituality. The artist was deeply moved by Pignatelli's rugged yet mystical appearance, seeing in him the likeness of Saint John the Baptist, a precursor, visionary, and believer. This connection adds depth to the sculpture, depicting a man deeply connected to nature and spirituality. In essence, the sculpture is a testament to art's power to capture the complexity of human character, conveying strength, mysticism, and faith. This is the first ever officially licensed Bust of John the Baptist NFT as a premium digital artwork in 3D by ElmonX. Holders can view and interact with the NFT in Augmented Reality.",
